<!-- The doctype is a required preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML was young, doctypes were
      meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered 
      good HTML which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things. Howeever, these days
      they don't do much and are basically just needed to make sure your document behaves correctly. -->
<!doctype html>

<!-- The html element wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root element.
      It also includes the lang attribute which sets the primary language of the document. -->
<html lang="en-US">

<!-- The head element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that
      isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like keywords and a 
      page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style the content, character set
      declarations and more -->
  
  <head>

<!-- meta charset equals utf-8. This element sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8 which
     includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages. Essentially, it can now handle any
     textual content you might put on it. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some
     problems later on. -->
    
    <meta charset="utf-8" />

<!-- The next line ensures that the page renders at the width of the browser viewport, preventing mobile
     browsers from rendering pages wider than the viewport and then shrinking them down.  -->
    
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />

<!-- The title element sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the 
      page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the page when you bookmark/favourite it.  -->

    </title>
  </head>

<!-- The body element contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether
     that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks or whatever else.  -->
