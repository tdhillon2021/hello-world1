This repository is for practising the GitHub Flow

I have a real interest in the Web, especially Web technologies such as HTML, CSS and Javascript.

I am also very passionate about Accessibility for both the Web and other digital products. I have been working in the industry for many years and am always striving to learn and improve myself in the field.
